# Factoiral 
- 1. normal solution - `function factorNType1`
- 2. iterate solution - `function factorNType2`
- 3. recursive solution - `function factorNType3`
- 3. tail recursive solution - `function factorNType4` - Functional programming

### example of Number! 
- 4! = 1x2x3x4 = 24
- 5! = 5x4x3x2 = 120

! is the symbol of factorial, place after the num => 5!
